# Introduction
This lab assignment has two parts which looks into the analysis of integration testing using reliability assessment tools. 

The first part looks at reliability growth testing which aims to give students practical experience evaluating a system's dependability based on failure information gathered during integration testing. Students must install a reliability growth assessment tool, such as SRTAT, and make plots of the SUT's failure rate and dependability in order to accomplish this. After completing this part, students will become familiar with reliability growth testing and its benefits, be able to assess the test results to determine the SUT's reliability, MTTF, and failure rate, and
learn how to use a reliability growth testing tool and its features.

The second part looks at reliability assessment using the Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). This is a useful tool for determining whether the intended failure rate or mean time to failure (MTTF) is being fulfilled. It is based on gathering failure information over time. This assignment's main goal is to acquaint students with the RDC tool and how to use it for reliability evaluation. When there are only a few failures, the times of the failures are known, and we want to determine the reliability trend of the system, we typically employ RDC. After completing this part, students will be able to assess the testing's suitability for a specific SUT MTTF by graphing the test results and learn how to use and understand the features of an RDCtool.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
For this part, our group decided to use the given "Failure Report 2.docx". Since the data was given in an incompatible format, we had to convert it into an .xlsx file, which is also available in the GitHub folder named "Failure_Report2.xlsx". 

## All Models
Here, we created a MVF graph using C-SFRAT to display data from all models.
